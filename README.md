# OFAA
Orbital free average atom model python code for producing ionizition and ion-ion pair potentials in plasmas. The electronic physics is based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation with LibXC, or Dirac based exchange functionals. Weiszacker and finite gradient corrections are yet to be fully implemented. Ionic correlations are generated through a companion hypernetted-chain package.
